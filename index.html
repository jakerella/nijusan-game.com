                        To reach enlightenment you must find, follow, and complete your path, but you are 
                        not alone, there are others on this path. The path is not for the timid, if 
                        enlightenment were easy, everyone would attain it. It is ever changing, and there 
                        are perils to keep even the wisest from succeeding. Choose your actions carefully!
